# SetPortLanHosting
## Note: Currently not verified for official speedrunning use.


This mod adds an option to quickhost, and a config for the port and the gamemode. 
The intended use for the mod is for co-op speedrunning.

This mod is meant to be used in conjunction with ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) or port forwarding. 
I made this for a friend because he was trying to do co-op runs and didn't want to re-port forward the LAN world every reset.
